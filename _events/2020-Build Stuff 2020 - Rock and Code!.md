description: We want to think of tech teams as rock bands. You and your team are a massive part of the Rock World now by putting your experience and diverse skills, together you are creating a hit-record during these uncertain times! This fall we are eager to show you that the Software world is like a Rock concert you have a stage where you put all your knowledge, tune your electric guitar, bass, a drum kit, and finally, you check your sound and perform! Sometimes the lights, as the bugs in your code, blinds you, but this is a small kick between you and your main goal â€” to rock it!
